## ðŸ«€ Heart Disease Prediction Mobile App

This mobile app was developed as part of a final year project to help predict the risk of heart disease using **neural network algorithms**. The goal was to provide an affordable and accessible tool for early detection using only a smartphone.

According to the Ministry of Health, 1 in 2 Malaysians suffers from high cholesterol â€” a major risk factor for heart disease. This app aims to assist users in assessing their health using medical input factors, without the need for costly hospital visits.

### ðŸ‘¥ My Role in the Project

Although this was not my main project, I contributed to:
- ðŸ§ª **Testing** and reviewing the prediction feature
- ðŸ’» Assisted in parts of the **mobile app development**
- ðŸŽ¯ Represented the project in a **university app competition**

This experience helped me understand mobile app workflows, health prediction logic using neural networks, and user-centered app testing.
